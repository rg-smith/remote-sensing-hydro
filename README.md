# remote-sensing-hydro

Welcome to the github page for Advanced Remote Sensing Methods in Hydrology! A general description of the course is given below:

Students will learn about the principal tools for sensing the flux and condition of surface water and groundwater with airborne and spaceborne sensors. Fluxes that will be investigated include evapotranspiration, precipitation, and change in water storage in soil, surface water and groundwater reservoirs. Remotely sensed data from thermal, passive microwave, microwave radar and gravimetric sensors will be used to investigate these fluxes. Practical geological engineering problems such as groundwater depletion, slope stability and flooding will be investigated. Advanced GIS tools will be used for the analysis, and students will apply the data and tools learned for a term project of their choosing. Students are expected to have a working knowledge of GIS software for this course. This can be satisfied by taking either GE3148 or GE5144, or from prior experience with the software. Interested students who are unsure if they have a proper background for the course are encouraged to email the instructor.
Key learning objectives are:
-	Understand how remote sensing theory can be related to mapping and modeling different hydrologic fluxes, including precipitation, soil moisture, surface water and groundwater.
-	Learn how to analyze hydrologic remote sensing data using advanced open-source geospatial tools, such as python and QGIS.
-	Applying theoretical and practical knowledge of hydrologic remote sensing to a term project of the studentâ€™s choosing.

In this course, students will be using a combination of python and QGIS for class exercises and ultimately their term project. As python labs and course materials are covered, they will be posted here.
