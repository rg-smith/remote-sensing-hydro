        "In this lab, we will explore the relationship between changes in groundwater levels and aquifer deformation. The theory describing this relationship is described in great detail in section 2.1 of this paper: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016WR019861. Read that section before completing this lab.\n",
        "\n",
        "The general principle is that the stress experienced by sedimentary grains is equal to the pore pressure subtracted from the total overburden stress. When pore pressure decreases (equivalent to a decrease in groundwater level in pressurized aquifers), the effective stress increases. This can cause consolidation of aquifer materials. \n",
        "\n",
        "The amount of deformation that occurs is described simply with the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\Delta$$b$=$\\Delta$$h$$S_{sk}$$b_0$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where $\\Delta$$b$ is the deformation, $\\Delta$$h$ is the change in groundwater level (head), $S_{sk}$ is the skeletal specific storage, and $b_0$ is the thickness of the material that is compacting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, if we know the change in head at any location in an aquifer, and the constant $S_{sk}$ relating the change in head to deformation, we can fairly simply calculate the deformation. There are two main challenges with implementing this. The first is that we *don't* know the change in head everywhere in the aquifer. In particular, clay layers within an aquifer or adjacent to it are the most compressible and thus have the largest deformation signal. These layers can experience significant changes in head, but it has a delayed response to the change in head experienced in an aquifer. We can model this using Equation 10 from the above referenced paper.\n",
        "\n",
        "The other main challenge is that $S_{sk}$ is not constant with time. This parameter changes when inelastic deformation occurs. This happens when the head drops below the lowest head that has been previously experienced. This value can be challenging to estimate unless we have a long time series of head at a well, and can also accurately model the change in head in less permeable clay layers. \n",
        "\n",
        "The code implemented below will work reasonably well for simulating deformation with *known* aquifer head if the head record is sufficiently long."
